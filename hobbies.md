During my free time, I enjoy:

### Hiking and Backpacking

I enjoy hiking and backpacking. Here are some photos of Alpine Lake in Idahoâ€™s Sawtooth mountains.

### Triathlons

I enjoy biking and swimming and decided I could run to complete the trifecta. My best race was the 2019 Boulder 70.3 Ironman

### Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu

I started this in graduate school and find it is one of my favorite ways to exercise. I competed in no-gi divisions.
