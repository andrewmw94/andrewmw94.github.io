# Hobbies

During my free time, I enjoy:

Hiking: I hike in state parks around Texas and in mountains whenever I can get away.


Backpacking / camping: I enjoy backpacking at least twice a year. My favorite trips have been in Idahoâ€™s Sawtooth mountains.


Triathlons: I enjoy biking and swimming and decided I could run to complete the trifecta. My best race was the 2019 Boulder 70.3 Ironman


Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu: I started this in graduate school and find it is one of my favorite ways to exercise. I compete in no-gi divisions.
