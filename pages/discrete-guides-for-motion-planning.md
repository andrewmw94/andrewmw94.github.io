# Discrete Guides for Motion Planning

In the first paper, we consider discrete leads that guide the search for a kinodynamic motion plan for a tractor-trailer type system. The leads are adapted online to improve scalability.

In the second paper, we consider multi-modal planning. A mode graph is used to search for transitions from an initial state to a goal state. We update the weights of this graph online based on motion planning attempts.
