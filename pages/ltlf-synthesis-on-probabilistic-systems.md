See representative examples from the paper on [GitHub](https://github.com/andrewmw94/gandalf_2020_experiments). All experiments used in the paper can be reproduced from this repo (e.g., by changing the grid dimensions). We are also happy to provide the exact scenarios used as well as examples that do not appear in the paper. Unfortunately, the full set of examples is ~5.5 GB, but we can provide a zip file upon request.
