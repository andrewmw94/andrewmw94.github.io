Below are some lines of research that I work on:

## Task and Motion Planning

![Task and Motion Planning](/assets/tmp.png)

Testing and Training Scenarios for Learning Task and Motion Planning Heuristics
In Task and Motion Planning (TMP or TAMP) a robot is given some discrete high-level goal to accomplish. The robot must find a sequence of actions that achieves this goal and the corresponding motion plans for each action

## Synthesis for Robotics

![Synthesis for Robotics](/assets/synthesis.png)

Part of an MDP Used to Model Robotic Manipulation Domains in Probabilistic Synthesis
In synthesis, the robot is given some task specification and some abstraction of it’s domain, including a model of potential interference (either by another robot, a human, or “nature”). The robot must then synthesize a correct-by-construction policy to guarantee / maximize the probability of task completion under this model

## Discrete Guides for Motion Planning

Multi-modal planners can use adaptive discrete guides to make their search more efficient
In motion planning, many problems can be solved more efficiently by using a discrete search over some simpler structure (e.g., a workspace decomposition or a mode-graph) to guide the search for a motion plan

The above projects only contain some of my papers. For a full list, please see publications.
