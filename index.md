Hi, Iâ€™m Andrew Wells. I recieved my Ph.D. in computer science at Rice University advised by Lydia Kavraki and Moshe Vardi. My research interests focus around task and motion planning, machine learning and formal methods for robotics. At Rice, I was funded by a NASA Space Technology Research Fellowship (read about it here), mentored by Dr. Julia Badger. Currently, I work on Tesla's Autopilot team.
