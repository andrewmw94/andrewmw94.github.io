Hi, Iâ€™m Andrew Wells. I recieved my Ph.D. in computer science at Rice University advised by [Lydia Kavraki](https://www.kavrakilab.org) and [Moshe Vardi](https://www.cs.rice.edu/~vardi/). My research interests focus around task and motion planning, machine learning and formal methods for robotics. At Rice, I was funded by a [NASA Space Technology Research Fellowship](https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/strg/nstrf_2017/) (read about it [here](http://csprofiles.rice.edu/2017/06/13/wells/)), mentored by Dr. Julia Badger. Currently, I am an applied scientist at Amazon Web Services.
